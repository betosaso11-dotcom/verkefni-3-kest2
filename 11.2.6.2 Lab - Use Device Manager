🧩 Lab – Use Device Manager (Using VirtualBox)
❓ What information is listed in the Device Manager window? Why would you use it?

Answer:
In the VirtualBox Windows virtual machine, the Device Manager window lists all virtual hardware devices installed on the system, such as virtual network adapters, display adapters, keyboards, and storage controllers.
It is used to check device status, troubleshoot hardware issues, and manage or update drivers inside the virtual machine. 🖥️🔍

❓ How would you install driver software for an older device that may not be automatically recognized by Windows?

Answer:
In VirtualBox, you can install the driver manually by opening Device Manager, clicking Action → Add legacy hardware, or by right-clicking the device and selecting Update driver.
You can then browse the virtual machine’s local storage or mounted ISO to install the driver software. 💿⚙️

🖥️ Step 2 – Display the monitor settings (VirtualBox)
❓ What additional information does Driver Details provide?

Answer:
Driver Details shows information about the virtual display driver used by VirtualBox, including driver file names, locations, and system components responsible for handling the virtual monitor. 📄🖥️

❓ What two options do you have for updating the driver?

Answer:

Search automatically for updated driver software

Browse my computer for driver software

These options allow Windows in VirtualBox to search online or use drivers installed locally in the virtual machine. 🌐🛠️

❓ What does the Roll Back Driver button do? Why could it be grayed out?

Answer:
The Roll Back Driver button restores the previous version of a driver if the current one causes issues.
In a VirtualBox environment, this option may be grayed out because no previous driver version has been installed for the virtual device. ↩️⚠️

❓ What are the other available options?

Answer:
Other available options include:

Update Driver

Disable Device

Uninstall Device

These options allow you to manage and troubleshoot virtual hardware devices within the VirtualBox virtual machine. ⚙️🧪
